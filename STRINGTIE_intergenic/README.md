#### Pipeline to identify candidate intergenic transcribed regions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

To run the pipeline you need first to edit the *config.txt* file with paths to different required annotation files and bam files. The input bam files used by this pipeline are generated by mapping RNAseq data to the reference genome.
The *data* folder contains predicted transcription start sites from YeasTSS database and annotated 5' and 3' UTRs.

To run the pipeline simply use the following command:
```
RunStringtie.sh
```

bedtools v2.31.1
